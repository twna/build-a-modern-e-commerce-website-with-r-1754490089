To add routing to a React application using React Router, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install React Router by running `npm install react-router-dom` if you haven't already.
2. Import the necessary components from `react-router-dom`, such as `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`.
3. Set up your router by wrapping your application in the `BrowserRouter` component.
4. Define your routes using the `Routes` and `Route` components.

Here's an example of how you might set up basic routing in a React application:


In this example, we have four routes:

- The root path (`/`) is associated with `HomePage`.
- The `/about` path is associated with `AboutPage`.
- The `/contact` path is associated with `ContactPage`.
- The `*` path is a catch-all route that will match any other path and is associated with `NotFoundPage`.

**Summary:**
To add routing to a React application, you need to install `react-router-dom`, use `BrowserRouter` to wrap your application, and define your routes with `Routes` and `Route`. The example code above demonstrates how to set up basic routing.

**Reasoning:**
The approach outlined above is the standard way to implement routing in a React application using React Router. It allows for the creation of a single-page application with navigation between different components without the need for full page reloads. The JSON checklist provides a clear set of tasks to ensure that routing is properly set up in the application.
