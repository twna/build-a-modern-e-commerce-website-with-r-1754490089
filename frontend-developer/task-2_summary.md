Certainly! Below is a simple example of a main `App` component in React, which is a common framework for frontend development. This component will serve as the root of your application.


### Summary:

The `App` component is a functional component that returns JSX representing the structure of a basic web application. It includes a header with a welcome message, a main section for content, and a footer with a copyright notice. This structure is a starting point and can be expanded with additional components and content as needed.

### Reasoning:

The `App` component is created as a functional component because it's a simple and modern way to define components in React. The JSX returned by the component includes basic semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, and `footer`) to give the application structure and accessibility. The `export default App;` statement makes the `App` component available for import in other parts of the application, such as the entry point file (usually `index.js` or `index.tsx` in a React project).
