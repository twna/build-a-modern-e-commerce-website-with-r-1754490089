To implement a checkout form component, I'll provide you with a simple example using HTML and JavaScript.

Summary:
The provided code snippet creates a checkout form with fields for the full name, email, address, phone, and credit card information. The form has basic styling for clarity and usability.

In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder logic with actual form submission code to send the data to a server.

Output JSON checklist block:


The approach taken ensures that the form is user-friendly and that the data can be easily collected and processed. The JSON checklist reflects the tasks completed in the code snippet.
