To implement a product detail component, I'll assume we're using React for this example. The component will display a product's image, name, price, description, and an "Add to Cart" button. Here's a simple implementation:


In this code, we have a React functional component called `ProductDetail` that takes a `product` object as a prop. This object is expected to have `imageUrl`, `name`, `price`, and `description` properties. The component renders an image, the product's name and price, a description, and a button to add the product to the cart. The `toFixed(2)` method is used to format the price to two decimal places.

Here's a plain-text summary of the component:

- The `ProductDetail` component is a React functional component.
- It takes a `product` object as a prop.
- The component renders the product's image, name, price, and description.
- It includes an "Add to Cart" button.
- The price is formatted to two decimal places.

And here's the JSON checklist for the component's features:


The reasoning for this approach is to create a simple and reusable component that can be used in different parts of the application where product details need to be displayed. The component is kept stateless for simplicity, and it can be enhanced with additional functionality such as handling the "Add to Cart" button click event as needed.
