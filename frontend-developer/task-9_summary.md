As a frontend developer, I can provide you with an example of how to style components using both plain CSS and a CSS-in-JS library. Let's take a simple button component as an example.

### Using Plain CSS

First, we'll create a CSS file named `styles.css`:


Next, we'll create an HTML file and include the CSS file:


### Using a CSS-in-JS Library (styled-components)

First, install `styled-components` if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn:


Next, create a styled button component in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:


Then, you can use this `Button` component in your application:


### Summary

For plain CSS, we created a `.button` class in a separate `styles.css` file and applied it to a button element in our HTML. For the CSS-in-JS approach using `styled-components`, we created a `StyledButton` component with the styles directly applied within the JavaScript file, which can then be used as a React component.

Here's a JSON checklist for the tasks completed:


The approach taken depends on the project requirements and personal or team preferences. Plain CSS is straightforward and widely used, while CSS-in-JS libraries like `styled-components` provide more dynamic styling capabilities and can be scoped to components, reducing the risk of style conflicts.
