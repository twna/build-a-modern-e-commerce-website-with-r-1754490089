To implement a navigation bar component, I'll provide you with an example using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This navigation bar will be responsive and include basic styling. You can later customize the styles and add more functionality as per your project requirements.


### Summary:

The provided code creates a simple navigation bar with four links: Home, News, Contact, and About. The navigation bar is styled to have a dark background with white text. When a user hovers over a link, the background color changes to light gray, and the text color changes to black, providing a visual cue that the link is interactive.

The CSS includes a media query to ensure that the navigation bar is responsive. When the screen width is 600 pixels or less, the links stack on top of each other instead of floating side by side, making the navigation bar more suitable for mobile devices.

### JSON Checklist:


### Reasoning:

The approach taken ensures that the navigation bar is functional, visually appealing, and responsive. The HTML structure is straightforward and semantic, which is good for accessibility and SEO. The CSS provides basic styling and responsiveness, which is essential for a modern web application. The JavaScript section is left empty as a placeholder for any future interactive features you may want to add, such as a dropdown menu or a mobile menu toggle.
