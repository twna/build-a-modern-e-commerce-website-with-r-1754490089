To set up authentication and authorization in a backend application, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Choose an authentication method (e.g., JWT, OAuth, Basic Auth).
2. Implement user registration and login endpoints.
3. Store user credentials securely (e.g., hashed passwords).
4. Generate and validate authentication tokens.
5. Implement middleware to protect routes that require authorization.
6. Assign roles to users and check roles in the authorization middleware.

Below is a simplified example of how you might implement JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization in a Node.js application using Express.js and a package like `jsonwebtoken` for JWT handling.


Summary:
- We have set up a simple user registration and login system.
- Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored.
- JWT tokens are generated upon login and must be provided to access protected routes.
- Middleware functions `authenticate` and `authorize` are used to protect routes.

Reasoning for the approach:
- JWT is a popular and stateless method for authentication, which is suitable for many web applications.
- Hashing passwords with `bcrypt` provides a secure way to store user credentials.
- Middleware functions allow for a clean separation of concerns and reusability across different routes.
- Role-based authorization provides flexibility in controlling access to various parts of the application.
