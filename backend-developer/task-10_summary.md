To set up a Node.js server with Express, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
2. Install Express.
3. Create a simple server with Express.
4. Start the server.

Here's the code for each step:


To use this code, you would first run `npm init -y` in your terminal to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.

Next, you would run `npm install express` to install the Express library.

Then, you would create a file, for example `server.js`, and paste the JavaScript code provided above into that file. This code imports the Express module, sets up a basic route that responds with "Hello World!" when the root URL (`/`) is accessed, and starts the server listening on port 3000.

Finally, you would start the server by running `node server.js` in the terminal. You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" indicating that the server has started successfully.

The reasoning behind this approach is to provide a simple and minimal setup for a Node.js server using Express. This setup is suitable for a wide range of web applications and can be easily extended with additional routes, middleware, and configurations as needed. Express is a popular and lightweight framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs.
