To implement the orders API endpoints, we'll need to define a few key operations that are typically associated with managing orders in a system. These operations might include:

1. Creating a new order
2. Retrieving an existing order by ID
3. Listing all orders
4. Updating an existing order
5. Deleting an order

For the purpose of this example, let's assume we are using a RESTful approach and a framework like Express.js for Node.js. Below is the code that defines these endpoints:


To use this router, you would need to import it into your main application file and use it as middleware for your Express application:


### Summary

The code provided defines a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing orders. It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, listing, updating, and deleting orders. The data is stored in a mock array for demonstration purposes, and would typically be replaced with a database in a production environment.

### Reasoning

The approach taken follows RESTful principles, which are widely adopted for creating APIs. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific operation on the resource (in this case, orders), and the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to signify the action being taken. This approach is intuitive and aligns with the expectations of most developers who will consume the API.
