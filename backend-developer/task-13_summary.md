To implement the users API endpoints, we'll need to define a set of RESTful endpoints that allow for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records. Below is an example of how these endpoints could be implemented in a Python Flask application. This is a high-level implementation and does not include actual database operations or error handling for simplicity.


Summary:
- We have defined a Flask application with endpoints to manage users.
- The `/users` endpoint with `GET` method lists all users.
- The `/users/<int:user_id>` endpoint with `GET` method retrieves a specific user by ID.
- The `/users` endpoint with `POST` method allows creating a new user.
- The `/users/<int:user_id>` endpoint with `PUT` method allows updating an existing user by ID.
- The `/users/<int:user_id>` endpoint with `DELETE` method allows deleting a user by ID.
- A mock database is used in the form of a list of dictionaries to simulate user records.

Reasoning for the approach:
- RESTful principles are followed to ensure that the API is standard and intuitive.
- Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework suitable for creating simple APIs.
- JSON is used as the data interchange format, which is a common practice for modern web APIs.
- The use of HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404) provides clear feedback on the outcome of API calls.
- A mock database is used to simplify the example and focus on the API endpoint logic rather than database operations.
