To integrate a Node.js server with PostgreSQL using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, we will use Sequelize, which is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

First, ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system. You will also need to have Node.js installed.

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up Sequelize with a Node.js server:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project if you haven't already:

2. Install the necessary packages:

3. Set up a Sequelize instance and configure it to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Create a file named `sequelize.js`:


4. Define a model for your application. For example, create a file named `models/User.js`:


5. Synchronize the models with the database. You can do this in your main application file, for example, `app.js`:


6. Now you can use the User model to interact with the PostgreSQL database through Sequelize. For example, to create a new user:


Here's a JSON checklist summarizing the steps:


The reasoning behind using Sequelize is that it provides a high-level abstraction for database interactions, which simplifies CRUD operations and reduces the amount of boilerplate code. It also helps to manage database migrations and relations between tables in a structured way.
